```{r datasets, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
library(datasets)
usgenefile <- paste0(getwd(),"/","alltablesGEcrops.csv")
usgene <- read.csv(usgenefile)
head(usgene)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
